This is a connector for the collector to continiously monitor telemetry's adhearence to a semantic convetion.

To use use a colelctor with this built in, and add this to your confing:
```
connectors:
  scc:
    trace:
    - match: "POST admin/.*"
      groups: # semantic convention groups to match
      - trace.http.server
      ignore: # attribute names that will not appear in missing or extra attributes in output.
      - error.type 
      include: # additional attributes that should be checked for.
      - project.id
    metrics: []
    log: []

service:
  pipelines:
    # This is your normal pipeline, add scc to it.
    traces:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp, scc]
    metrics:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp, scc]
    logs:
      receivers: [otlp]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [otlp, scc]
    # This is your scc logs data
    logs/2:
      receivers: [scc]
      exporters: [otlp]
```
